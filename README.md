# Silvie JS
Silvie is a TypeScript based back-end framework. It is based on NodeJs and is meant to ease the process of starting a NodeJs application in a better structure. 

This framework is still in testing and development phase, forgive me for the missing documentation. I am working on it and it will be ready soon.

You can still use it with [create-silvie-app](https://npmjs.com/package/create-silvie-app). Which will create a project from the sample boilerplate for you.
