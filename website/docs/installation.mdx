## Requirements
Before you install silvie, you need to make sure Node.js has been installed on your computer. It is always a good habit to have
the latest version.

So verify your installation by running these two commands in **Terminal** or **CMD**. They will show you the installed
version of your `node` and `npm`.

```bash
node -v
# v15.1.0

npm -v
# 7.0.8
```
You may see different results when you run these command, but it is okay. You can
check the latest version on [official Node.js website](https://nodejs.org).

## Installing Silvie
You've got two options to install Silvie on your machine: *using a creator package*, or *installing it manually* in your
project.

### Creator package <sup>(recommended)</sup>
The creator package is a npm package called [create-silvie-app](https://www.npmjs.com/package/create-silvie-app) built
for this case. It will create a project for you from a boilerplate template.
It also creates some basic models, controllers and database migrations to get you going from there.

#### NPX
The shortcut for executing npm packages is the `npx` command. It will execute the binaries from npm packages, even if
they were not downloaded before. NPX is coming with the NPM package, so you don't need to install anything.

```bash
npx create-silvie-app APP_NAME
```

#### Global Install
Otherwise, if you are going to use this package more often, you can install this package globally on your machine.

<Tabs
    groupId="command-type"
    defaultValue="npm"
    values={[
        { label: 'NPM', value: 'npm' },
        { label: 'Yarn', value: 'yarn' }
    ]}
>
<TabItem value="npm">

```bash
npm install --global create-silvie-app
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="yarn">

```bash
yarn global add create-silvie-app
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

This will add the package to your globally installed npm packages, and then you can just create a Silvie app by running
one of these commands.

<Tabs
    groupId="command-type"
    defaultValue="npm"
    values={[
        { label: 'NPM', value: 'npm' },
        { label: 'Yarn', value: 'yarn' },
        { label: 'CLI', value: 'cli' }
    ]}
>
<TabItem value="npm">

```bash
npm init silvie-app APP_NAME
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="yarn">

```bash
yarn create silvie-app APP_NAME
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="cli">

```bash
create-silvie-app APP_NAME
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

Now you should see a directory with the name `APP_NAME` that you have written after the command. Now just `cd` to that
directory and [start the application](#running-silvie).

### Manual Installation
I think this option is for those who know how Silvie actually works under the hood, and have a good understanding of the
standard [directory structure](directory-structure.md) and [configuration](configuration.md).

#### Step Zero
You need to have a node project first. If you have created your empty project, just go to [step 1](#step-1).

:::note Node Project
A node project is a directory with a valid `package.json` file.
If you don't know how to create a node project, the next command should help.
:::

```bash
mkdir test-silvie-app
cd test-silvie-app
npm init -y
```

#### Step One
As the first step you have to add [silvie](https://www.npmjs.com/package/silvie) package to your project dependencies.
This command will install the latest version of silvie in your projects `node_modules` directory.

<Tabs
    groupId="command-type"
    defaultValue="npm"
    values={[
        { label: 'NPM', value: 'npm' },
        { label: 'Yarn', value: 'yarn' }
    ]}
>
<TabItem value="npm">

```bash
npm install --save silvie
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="yarn">

```bash
yarn add silvie
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

#### Step Two
Now you should create the initial directories and files. Make sure your structure matches the one introduced in
[Directory Structure chapter](directory-structure.md).

Also, you can run this command to make silvie check everything for you and reports you the missing parts of project:

```bash
silvie check
```

Or easily create the missing parts by running this command:

```bash
silvie fix
```

#### Step Three
If you want to create the files your self, you need to create the initial files based on what we are going to discuss in
the [Directory Structure](directory-structure.md) and [Configuration](configuration.md) sections.

## Running Silvie
Now that you have installed silvie, start the app by running the following command:

<Tabs
    groupId="command-type"
    defaultValue="npm"
    values={[
        { label: 'NPM', value: 'npm' },
        { label: 'Yarn', value: 'yarn' },
        { label: 'CLI', value: 'cli' }
    ]}
>
<TabItem value="npm">

```bash
npm run dev
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="yarn">

```bash
yarn dev
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="cli">

```bash
silvie dev
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>
