Silvie is a Typescript based Node.js framework. It is made with love to make take the best Typescript offers into the 
powerful Node.js platform, and create a comfortable project structure for you to organize your work, leaving the logical
parts of coding for you.


## History
### Javascript
Javascript is one of the most used languages in the world. It was first made by 
*[Brendan Eich](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brendan_Eich)* at 1995, and it is one of the core technologies that is 
being used to create webpages, making intractable pages, animate things, validate forms, etc. Javascript was getting 
bigger and more powerful during these years. The latest version **ES2020** was released at *June 2020*. The community is
working so hard to make the coding world more beautiful with javascript.

### Node.js
We love Javascript, and use it in almost every application we develop. In 2009, 
*[Ryan Dahl](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ryan_Dahl)* has introduced *[Node.js](https://nodejs.org)* to the world, and 
a lot of back-end developers are using it all over the world since then. It was powered by Google V8 Engine and was 
built for javascript developers to run their scripts out of a browser context.

### Typescript
*[Typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org)* has been made by *[Microsoft](https://microsoft.com)* in 2012. It was 
meant to be a better javascript. As you may already know, javascript is a dynamically typed language. It is okay for a 
small scripting project, but when it comes to large scale projects, you feel the lack of a powerful type system and OOP 
concepts which is missing in javascript. So typescript addresses this issue and provides some high quality coding 
standards along with the javascript itself.

## Silvie
As you've read before, Silvie is a Node.js framework, and is meant to let you develop your back-end applications without
getting your hands dirty to configure a lot of things just to get to the 0 point. Silvie handles those parts for you.

Silvie has a clean directory structure which organizes your project files to have everything in its own place. Most of 
the files in those directories will be automatically loaded at runtime. So you don't need to create exporting index 
files in your directories.

It uses [Webpack](https://webpack.js.org) and [Babel](https://babeljs.io) to convert your codes into a node compatible 
version so Node.js will be able to run them without the need of providing any extra flags. This gives us the opportunity 
to use latest javascript features, along with the powerful type system of typescript. It also has some features to 
execute on the fly, transpile and build a node compatible version or bundle the whole project into a single file.

I have to mention that it is still at development phase, I am working to make it stable as soon as possible. Don't 
forget to check for the latest version. 1.0.0 will be there soon.

Here you can see some of Silvie's key features:

- ES6+ Support
- Typescript Support
- GraphQL Support
- Database Helpers
- Storage Helpers
- MVC Structure
